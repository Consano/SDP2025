I made 3 modifications to [run.py](run.py) mainly
1. Hard coding the path variables - line 33
   ```Python
   COCO_IMAGES = "/Users/jackk/torch_flow/DataSet/test2017"
   COCO_ANN = "/Users/jackk/torch_flow/DataSet/image_info_test2017/annotations/image_info_test2017.json"
   ```
2. Removing the redefinitions to the environment variables - line 38
   ```Python
   #COCO_IMAGES = os.getenv("COCO_IMAGES")
   #COCO_ANN = os.getenv("COCO_IMAGES")
   ```
3. Adding a sanity check to ensure the paths and dataset are added correctly - line 267
   ```Python
   print(f"Attempting to draw {num_samples} samples from a dataset of size {dataset_size}.")
   ```

All changes are marked with -Jack as a tag

I had success using the following command but calling run_segformer.sh directly should also work, especially as this only runs the segformer model once
```Powershell
python run.py --model_name segformer --batch_size 1 --device cuda
```

Inexplicably I had to create the folders for the outputs, paths should be
`\torch_flow\non-gemm-out\X`
Where X is the various output folders, generally following the format of `segformer_cpu_1` or the like. Generally the error code is verbose enough to understand what exactly is missing.
